187510,199526,12016,s0: ok so  inside there is  inside of the membrane there is less NA+ and more K+...ok?,task,s0,
199526,207165,7639,s0:ok so..second paragraph in the midl-s3:yeah yeah,task,s0,
207165,213277,6112, s0:so..s3: ??? they just like the comparness,task,s3,
213277,231001,17724,s0:so  perhaps there is this fact and then the..the forth paragraph..explains what's...euh...their role  in the...In fact kind of to the answer the question if you really don't understand the question. ,task,s0,

246717,249980,3263,s3: and he is the same but he is larger? s0: yes,task,s3,
249980,258399,8419,s2: but how can I say that??? ,task,s2,
258399,266107,7708,s0: yes     s2:where? where is that? s0: euh  it was on the screen I ???  s2: oh you can't ???? s0:no,interaction,s2,

296312,303628,7316,s0: in fact thereis a movment  there is....euh...nnn...euh,task,s0,
303628,311981,8353,s0: K+ wants  ion wants to go inside...euh no outside of the membrane and NA+ inside.,task,s0,
311981,319194,7213,s0: they want to exchange euh ????,task,s0,
319194,322587,3393,s0: it's what's explain in forth paragraph,task,s0,
322587,329015,6428,(Silence),,,
329015,341273,12258,s0: K+..yeah in the forth paragraph  that means toward the exterior of the neuron for K+ ions and towards the interior for NA+ ions,task,s0,

344307,358377,14070,s0: and after they say that K+ ion diffuse more rapidlly  so they go out more rapidly than ions coming inside and that's what explains the resting potential,task,s0,

442935,445118,2183,s3: yes ????,task,s3,
445118,458306,13188,s0: it's what's written in forth paragraph-s2: ah yeah yeah-s0: and euh  this is...yes you're looking at the process that puts back the ions in their original place  so then,task,s0,
458306,466191,7885,s0: with this  we have what like K+ that going outside faster than NA+ going inside,task,s0,
466191,476844,10653,s0: ok? s3:what do ???   s0: that's what they say euh..furthermore K+ ions diffuse more rapidly than sodium ions,task,s3,

482319,491736,9417,s0: there was a surface a negative charges ??? the neuron....and that's what creating the resting potential,task,s0,

499224,504492,5268,(silence),,,
504492,514214,9722,s0: so it is ok  we say that the role of NA+ is to go euh.. s1: inside s0:inside and the role of K+ is to go outside,task,s0,
514214,518594,4380,s1: but do they have other role?,task,s1,
518594,523742,5148,s1: what is the goal to s0: ok mabe in same paragraph....,task,s1,
523742,528052,4310,s1:when ??? the sodium go inside?,task,s1,
528052,534210,6158,s0: yeah but this is just to balance the charges,task,s0,
534210,536518,2308,s?: yeah it's really???,tech,,
536518,540576,4058,s3: oh we have like one minute,org.task,s3,
540576,544337,3761,s2: but we canot??? right? s0: yes,org.task,s2,
544337,552652,8315,s1: what does it do the... s0: this create....,task,s1,
552652,557349,4697,s1:...the potential?,task,s1,
557349,565028,7679,s0: euh a charge in fact  the...it polaraize the neuron and so gives it its ????,task,s0,
565028,569984,4956,s1: inaudible,,,
569984,572797,2813,s3: ok since we have the roles,task,s3,
572797,575426,2629,,,,
575426,582118,6692,s0: but this is..s1: ah ok it a way to give aneuron impulse.,task,s0,
582118,592510,10392,s0: so are you ok with the answer saying that NA+ goes inside and K+ goes outside?,task,s0,
592510,598546,6036,(silence),,,
598546,603622,5076,s1: next question       s0: maybe i can just...ah ok you said it,org.task,s1,

625021,627939,2918,s3: is it just to go ????,task,s3,
627939,636531,8592,s0: yes  but then there is a pump to exchange the ??? to go back to the other state,task,s0,
636531,646988,10457,(silence),,,
646988,652390,5402,s0: so they manage...the po???,task,s0,
652390,665447,13057,s0: yeah..this is my keyboard s2:???,tech,s0,
665447,667639,2192,????,,,
667639,678446,10807,s0: do you understand s2:mhm ...???,task,s0,
678446,683700,5254,s2:???? ,task,s2,
683700,692225,8525,(silence),,,
692225,700931,8706,s2:??? s0: yeah so we should change to the other task   s1:???,org.task,s2,
700931,705395,4464,s1: ??? finish??  s0: yeah but I think ????',org.task,s1,
705395,711483,6088,s3: ok well...????,org.task,s3,
711483,726838,15355,s3:actually the role of ???? is heu kind of like enable the communication between the neuron  because here in this explenation it says like how...how it works,task,s3,
726838,738720,11882,s3: well the thing is that when...like ??? the neuron are like in a negative state...and then when they positive euh... I don't know like,task,s3,
738720,749511,10791,s3: then when the sodium comes inside  it then..is taken outside because the difference of the charges in both ????,task,s3,
749511,761272,11761,s3: so it's like  there are like  by nature  there are like resting here and then when sodium came like it..it goes but then it..it.. gives it a way out,task,s3,
761272,765178,3906,s3: ok well I'm actually not sure of it but...,task,s3,
765178,771954,6776, s3: it's the way  I understand  but other thing are why not..saying anything about the roles....so,task,s3,
771954,779384,7430,s3: well I just saying wha't happening but why not actually...   s1:so now ????,task,s3,
779384,786447,7063,s0: so here is my scheme s1: we have to s0: ???? s1: illustrate the generation of resting potential,org.wb,s0,
786447,799551,13104,s0: that's it... that's why...... my idea is just that it's created by the fact that there is more s3: here there????   s0:ions going out than inside.,org.wb,s0,
799551,804613,5062,(silence),,,
804613,809023,4410,s3: then the steps ????,task,s3,

857040,871030,13990,s3:actualy the K+ is is inside the... s0: yeah but it going outside  want to go... s3: ok ok. s0: and the NA+..yes it is... yes there are more like you can say it this way if you want.,task,s3,
871030,876663,5633,s3:the K..the K is actually inside when the sodium arrives s0:yes,task,s3,
876663,888094,11431,s3: it push the others outside s0: exactlly s3: but...but..but the external environment makes the K goes inside so the Na goes outside again.,task,s3,
888094,910955,22861,s3: yeah something like that.. s0: yes no you have the..the........what I understand is the process  if you don't have like some pump to back inside  the process just like ??? and ions interaction  we just put the NA+ inside of the neuron and the K+ outside  beause there is like euh,task,s3,
910955,928346,17391,s0: polarisation which like this one ???? just equilibrate the two spaces. s3: yes s0:  So and after you have like the small pump I tried draw  just to go back in the initial state,task,s0,
928346,958555,30209,s3: ok this thing is to go in initial state again : s0: yes  this it to...this...the big arrows are what's happening  normally and the small arrow are  are like working again of the nature. s2: yeah yeah so ??? s1:???? s0: the nature want to put NA+ inside and K+ until there are the same concentration inside and outside,org.wb,s3,
958555,966555,8000,s2: yea but  you know that's general but it could be ????,task,s2,
966555,971373,4818,s0: yeah it's true s2: so we did ????,task,s2,

1007454,1016785,9331,s3: but what...the thing is that this is...like the neuron are actually like connected to others neuron right?,task,s3,
1016785,1023888,7103,s3: so maybe we should like try to put like some other s2: yes  s3: in the other side  so we like ????,task,s3,
1023888,1032624,8736,s3: because this NA+ goes inside and then goes outside again right? so it goes inside an other one after,task,s3,
1032624,1049935,17311,s1:I...I don't think it's euh to an other one...there... there are neurons and there are in sort of.... a ...a bath of sodium and....and potassium,task,s1,

1148233,1180676,32443,s0: it's just to say that..that's permable  some stuff can go through the membrane  but you have two different process... s1: this is the membrane  so we didn't... s0:you have one process  which is like the natual one. the natural which one to basicly have the same concentration outside and inside of the membrane and you have the other one  which is a force process  using pumps to reverse the transformation to..euh to go back to euh rest...to a rest potential  s1: yes,task,s0,
