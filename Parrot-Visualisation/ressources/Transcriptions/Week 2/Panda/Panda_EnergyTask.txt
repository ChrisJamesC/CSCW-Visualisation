default		00:02:43.730	163.73	00:02:52.100	172.1	00:00:08.370	8.37	so it's minus multliplyinghe capacity and then minus production cost
default		00:02:52.290	172.29	00:03:01.700	181.7	00:00:09.410	9.41	And also this, yeah, the construction cost is to be multiplied by ...
default		00:03:03.440	183.44	00:03:03.810	183.81	00:00:00.370	0.37	yeah

default		00:04:22.300	262.3	00:04:25.950	265.95	00:00:03.650	3.65	so it depends on how many actually you sell to get back
default		00:04:26.180	266.18	00:04:26.670	266.67	00:00:00.490	0.49	yeah

default		00:05:55.593	355.593	00:06:08.050	368.05	00:00:12.457	12.457	now we can just use the 0.8 like we have ... so we don't need more technology
