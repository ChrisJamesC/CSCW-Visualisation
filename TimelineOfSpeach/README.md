For continuous data such as time series, a streamgraph can be used in place of stacked bars. This example also demonstrates path transitions to interpolate between different layouts. Streamgraph algorithm, colors, and data generation inspired by [Byron and Wattenberg](http://www.leebyron.com/else/streamgraph/).
