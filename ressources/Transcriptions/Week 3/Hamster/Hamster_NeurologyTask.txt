Channel1		00:16:13.520	973.52	00:16:20.960	980.96	00:00:07.440	7.44	The role of the NA+ is to do that and the neuron opens it to active that.
Channel1		00:16:20.960	980.96	00:16:24.710	984.71	00:00:03.750	3.75	Ok so the neuron opens the channel and Na starts flowing in
Channel1		00:16:24.710	984.71	00:16:25.960	985.96	00:00:01.250	1.25	Yes

Channel1		00:16:30.150	990.15	00:16:31.680	991.68	00:00:01.530	1.53	the potential changes
Channel1		00:16:31.680	991.68	00:16:38.350	998.35	00:00:06.670	6.67	Because of the, it has like, they said that the concetration of the Na and the K  is different from the inside and the outside 
Channel1		00:16:38.350	998.35	00:16:38.880	998.88	00:00:00.530	0.53	Tres bien
Channel1		00:16:38.880	998.88	00:16:42.620	1002.62	00:00:03.740	3.74	So you have a significant different charges from the inside and the outside

Channel1		00:16:49.460	1009.46	00:16:55.870	1015.87	00:00:06.410	6.41	The neuron will use the Na to change its potential

Channel1		00:19:14.500	1154.5	00:19:18.400	1158.4	00:00:03.900	3.9	So maybe the point 2 below the figures is once they

Channel1		00:19:31.350	1171.35	00:19:32.950	1172.95	00:00:01.600	1.6	Yeah, yeah, ok, yeah.

Channel1		00:20:06.020	1206.02	00:20:07.500	1207.5	00:00:01.480	1.48	But it's getting to the peak potential
